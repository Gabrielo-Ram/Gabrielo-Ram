Hello ðŸ‘‹, thank you for stopping by!

I'm a full-stack developer finishing my senior year at [Williams College](https://www.williams.edu/) as a Computer Science major. Web development is my bread and butter, but I love to play around with mobile and backend code too. 

In a world slowly being overrun by AI, my mission is to build products **with a human touch**. Every web experience I design is guided by **empathy, clarity,** and **impact**. 

Check out some of the projects I've been working on!
